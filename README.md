Description:
This is a script I wrote to secure a Windows computer which requires a password to unlock. It simply sleeps until a hot key is pressed to be activated. Once activated it will wait for 30 seconds and monitor all keyboard and mouse movements. If the mouse is moved or a key is pressed it will lock the computer. While in the activated state one can only unlock it by pressing the hotkey only known to the user.

Purpose:
The purpose of this program is not only to lock the computer when an intruder attempts to use the computer, but to act as a trip wire to show an intruder attempted to access the computer.


Instructions:

Alt + 1 to run the program, meaning its motitoring keypresses and mouse movements. If movement or keypress is detected it will lock the computer.
Alt + 2 to sleep for 60 minutes, meaning mouse movements and keypresses will not be monitored. 
Alt + 3 to exit. The tray icon is hidden! So that method of exit it not plausable.
