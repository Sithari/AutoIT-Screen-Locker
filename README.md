# AutoIT-Screen-Locker
Created by Rakesh Passa

The program locks your computer after a certain amount of time. This program
was created for a specific need for me and is probably unsuable to others unless
the source code is modified. 

Instructions:
Alt + 1 to run the program, meaning its motitoring keypresses and mouse 
movements. If movement or keypress is detected it will lock the computer.

Alt + 2 to sleep for 60 minutes, meaning mouse movements and keypresses will not
be monitored. 

Alt + 3 to exit. The tray icon is hidden! So that method of exit it not plausable.
